# RainStorm: A Hybrid Distributed File System and Stream Processing Framework

## Overview

RainStorm is a distributed stream-processing framework developed by combining features from multiple distributed system components, including:
- Distributed Group Membership.
- Hybrid Distributed File System (HyDFS).
- Real-time Stream Processing with RainStorm.
This system enables scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient processing of real-time streams with exactly-once semantics. Built with the foundations of distributed group membership and file systems, RainStorm can handle failures gracefully while performing distributed computations.
